Tools for DMing 1st Edition AD&amp;D

These tools work with .json files containing hand-entered data from AD&D books - currently the 1e Player's Handbook, Unearthed Arcana, and Oriental Adventures, which are referred to internally as "editions". There is also an edition called "Custom" for things from Dragon, homebrew, or whatever. 

Three tools at the moment: 
1. Display class experience levels for an XP value, and how far it is to the next level.
2. Display saving throws needed by a class and level, or roll a series of saving throws.
3. Roll a series of attacks by a THAC0 against an AC, showing hits and damage.

This project was inspired by the tediousness of DMing a party against a group of creatures at once, like a squad of demons or a swarm of giant wasps. Rather than roll a lot of attacks or saving throws I tend to take shortcuts, which I think trivializes an encounter. So I wanted a handy tool that would let me resolve a bunch of attacks or saves all at once, and show me the results in a way I could easily use. I also like to know where characters are in their levels, so when they are about to level up I can plan for some interesting events that coincide with that. After figuring out the mechanics for classes generally, the next step is to maintain a party list with character stats and apply these same utilities to it.
