Tools for DMing 1st Edition AD&amp;D

These tools work with .json files containing hand-entered data from AD&D books - currently the 1e Player's Handbook, Unearthed Arcana, and Oriental Adventures, which are referred to internally as "editions". There is also an edition called "Custom" for things from Dragon, homebrew, or whatever. 

Three tools at the moment: 
1. Display the experience level of any class for an XP value.
2. Display saving throws needed by a class and level, or roll a series of saving throws.
3. Roll a series of attacks by a THAC0 against an AC, showing hits and damage.

This project was inspired by the tediousness of DMing a party against a group of creatures at once, like squads of demons or swarms of giant wasps. Rather than roll a couple dozen attacks or saving throws I tended to take shortcuts, which I think trivializes the opponents. So I wanted a handy tool that would let me resolve a bunch of attacks or saves all at once, and show me the results in a way that was instantly usable. After figuring out how to do this generically for classes and levels, the next step is to maintain a party list with character stats and apply these same utilities to it.
